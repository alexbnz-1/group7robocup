# HX12K wiring through the Digital Level Shift board

This setup uses one servo on Digital Raw 1 channel D30.

## CPU to level shifter

Connect the CPU board's 8-pin **DIGITAL RAW1** header to the Digital Level
Shift board's 8-pin input with the keyed straight-through cable. The CPU header
is labelled, in order:

`3V | GND | D30 | D31 | D32 | D33 | GND | 3V`

The four output mappings are:

- Output A -> D33
- Output B -> D32
- Output C -> D31
- Output D -> D30

D30-to-D was confirmed by testing the physical boards. The other three follow
the same reversed connector order.

## External servo power

1. With power disconnected, place the level-shifter power jumper in **Ex**.
2. Connect the external servo supply to the level shifter's external-power
   input, observing positive and negative polarity.
3. Use a supply voltage suitable for the HX12K and capable of its peak/stall
   current. Do not power the servo from a Teensy 3.3 V pin.
4. The level-shifter board establishes the required shared ground through its
   CPU cable; do not bypass the board with the servo power lead.

## Servo to output D

Plug the HX12K into output **D** on the right side of the level-shifter board.
Match the connector markings rather than relying only on wire colours:

- Servo ground (normally brown or black) to GND.
- Servo power (normally red) to the shifted/external supply rail.
- Servo signal (normally orange, yellow, or white) to signal.

Never reverse the power and ground pins. Check the board silkscreen and the
servo lead before applying external power.

## Firmware behaviour

Each `Hx12kServo` uses a 1000-2000 microsecond pulse range and maps 0-135 degrees
across that range. All four start disabled. In the debug GUI, enter Debug Mode,
press Run Robot, then use **Set HX12K servo angles**. Tick only the outputs you
want to move and set an independent angle for each. Begin near the centre (67.5
degrees) with linkages disconnected. **Disable HX12K output**, global STOP, and
leaving Debug Mode detach all four pulse outputs.
